# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-Modeled-from-Machine-Vision-Based-Lettuce-Growth-Stage-Classification-in
The repository contains the code used for the research paper entitled A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms Modeled from Machine Vision-Based Lettuce Growth Stage Classification in Smart Aquaponics as published by International Journal of Environmental Science and Development in 2020

File Descriptions:
1. The Morphological Feature Extraction file is in .m file type as it was coded using MathWorks: MATLAB 2018a. It extracts the morphological features of lettuce images acquired from a Smart Aquaponics System located in Morong, Rizal, Philippines. 
2. Lettuce_Balanced is the file where the features from the Morphological Feature Extraction code were stored in csv format. The features include the biomass perimeter, biomass area, convex area, convexhull area, biomass convexhull perimeter, biomass compactness, biomass solidity, biomass convexity, dominant leaf major axis length, biomass major axis length, biomass minor axis length, length of skeleton, and perimeter of the 180 samples from the image dataset. The file also contained the three categorical response values which represent the growth stage of lettuce: vegetative, head development, and harvest.
3. The features were used to train the algorithms found in the Machine Learning Algorithms.py The ML algorithms used were Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine
